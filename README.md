Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Here are three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering:
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968):
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany. This conference highlighted the growing complexity of software systems and the need for a disciplined approach to software development.
It marked the beginning of software engineering as a formal discipline, leading to the establishment of methodologies and best practices for managing software development projects.

Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s):
The Waterfall model, introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce, is one of the earliest methodologies for software development. It emphasizes a linear and sequential approach, with distinct phases such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The Waterfall model provided a structured framework for software development, but its limitations in handling changes and iterative development led to the eventual emergence of more flexible methodologies.

The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001):
The Agile Manifesto was published, emphasizing values such as customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software frequently. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban emerged, focusing on iterative development, flexibility, and close collaboration with stakeholders. Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by promoting adaptive planning, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement, addressing many limitations of traditional approaches like Waterfall.
These milestones reflect the evolving understanding of software development needs and the continuous improvement in practices to address those needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically includes the following phases:

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
Description: In this phase, stakeholders’ needs and requirements are gathered through interviews, surveys, and analysis of existing systems. The goal is to understand what the software should do and document these requirements in detail.
Outcome: A Requirements Specification document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

2. System Design:
Description: Based on the requirements, the system’s architecture and design are created. This includes designing the software’s structure, interfaces, and data flows. The design is typically divided into high-level design (architecture) and detailed design (specific components).
Outcome: Design documents and models that guide the development process.

3. Implementation (Coding):
Description: Developers write the actual code based on the design documents. This phase involves translating design specifications into a functional software product.
Outcome: The working software codebase.

4. Testing:
Description: The software is tested to identify and fix defects or bugs. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, are performed to ensure the software meets the requirements and functions correctly.
Outcome: A validated software product with documented test results.

5. Deployment:
Description: The software is installed and made operational in the target environment. This phase involves setting up the software for use by the end-users and may include configuration and training.
Outcome: The software is live and accessible to users.

6. Maintenance:
Description: After deployment, the software is monitored and maintained to address any issues that arise, make necessary updates, and enhance functionality based on user feedback. This phase ensures the software remains effective and relevant over time.
Outcome: Ongoing support and updates to the software.
These phases represent a systematic approach to software development, helping ensure that software projects are well-managed and meet their intended goals.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
